# LearnSTL
This repo contains a C++ console application with a few exercises.
You can use them to check your knowledge about the Standard Template Library's [algorithms](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm) and other C++20 features like [Ranges](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges) and [Concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concepts).
The exercises are mainly about using algorithms on STL containers - mostly vector.
If you would like to get the (possible) solutions for each exercise, please contact me at github@stapenhorst.io

### IDE
I used the Visual Studio 2022 IDE (v 17.4.2) to create the examples but I hope the code works in other IDEs just fine. If you use Visual Studio 2019, you probably need to change the setting "Platform Toolset" to the platform version available in your environment.

When opening the solution in Visual Studio the first time, you should collaps all the regions so you get an idea of the code structure.
It will look something like this:

It helps you to navigate through the different sections.
